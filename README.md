# Random Password Generator

## This weeks challenge was to use the source code that was provided to generate a secure random password generator. We were given a complete html and css file as well as a brifely started javascript file. My biggest challange was linking the numbers, symbols, and alphabet to actually combine themselves and generate a random algorithim. I really enjoyed this project and will refer back to it in the future to create different randomizers. Thank god for MDN 😂 🙏🏼. 


Your Task

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this list of password special characters from the OWASP Foundation.
